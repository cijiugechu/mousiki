//! Fixed-point approximation of `128 * log2(x)` used throughout the SILK signal-processing helpers.
//!
//! This module mirrors `silk_lin2log` from `silk/lin2log.c` in the reference C implementation. The
//! routine exposes a cheap logarithm that scales its input by 128, delivering results in the Q7
//! domain without resorting to floating-point math. The translation sticks closely to the C code,
//! including the implicit behaviour for zero and negative inputs.

/// Approximation of `128 * log2(x)` for 32-bit integers.
///
/// The return value lives in the Q7 domain â€“ i.e. it is the base-2 logarithm multiplied by 128.
/// The behaviour matches the C implementation: non-positive inputs yield a result of `-128`, and
/// negative values are accepted for completeness even though the original algorithm only relies on
/// non-negative magnitudes.
